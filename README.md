## Counters App - (using hooks)

Self-challenge to rebuild [counters app](https://github.com/merzainc/counters) only using React hooks and functional components.

### Setup 
This project was created using yarn and [Vite v4.4.1](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

#### Install Dependencies
From the project folder, install the dependencies:


    yarn install
    
#### Start Server
To run app in development mode use: 


    yarn dev
This will launch the vite server on port 5713. If that port is busy, you can set a different point using Vite ` --port` cli option.

### Concepts Learned / Applied 
- [x] Conditional Rendering 
- [x] useState, useContext hooks 
- [x] Using Vite dev server (fast HMR)
- [x] Building app from scratch
